There are several other frameworks and libraries in Python that you can use to create desktop applications. Some of the notable ones include:

PyQt/PySide:

PyQt and PySide are Python bindings for the Qt framework. They provide a wide range of features and a powerful set of tools for building cross-platform desktop applications.

Kivy:

Kivy is a Python library for developing multi-touch applications. It's known for its versatility and is suitable for creating applications with touch interfaces.

Tkinter (already mentioned):

Tkinter is Python's standard GUI toolkit and comes bundled with Python. It is simple to use and suitable for basic to moderately complex desktop applications.
Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
GTK (PyGTK / PyGObject):

GTK is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. PyGTK and PyGObject provide Python bindings for GTK.
PyGObject: https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/
PyGTK (deprecated, but some projects may still use it): https://pypi.org/project/PyGTK/
FLTK (PyFLTK):

FLTK is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit, and PyFLTK provides Python bindings for it.

The choice of framework depends on your specific requirements, such as platform compatibility, ease of use, feature set, and the look and feel you desire for your application. Each framework has its strengths, and the best one for you will depend on your project's needs and your personal preferences.



pip install tensorflow


The code you provided is a Python script that uses the PyQt5 library to create a desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI). Specifically, it is using PyQt5 to design the UI components such as labels, buttons, and frames. The application is meant for pneumonia detection in chest X-rays.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant parts:

PyQt5:

The code imports classes from the PyQt5 library to create the GUI. It uses modules like QtWidgets, QtCore, and QtGui to design the main window, buttons, labels, and other UI elements.
PyQt5 is a set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework, and it allows you to create cross-platform desktop applications with a native look and feel.
QFileDialog:

It uses QFileDialog to prompt the user to select an image file. The selected file path is then used for further processing.
QMovie:

The code utilizes QMovie to display an animated GIF ("picture.gif") in a QLabel. This gives a visual element to the application.
TensorFlow and Keras:

The script uses TensorFlow and Keras for machine learning tasks. It loads a pre-trained model (chest_xray.h5) for pneumonia detection and applies it to the selected image.
win32com.client:

The code uses win32com.client to incorporate text-to-speech functionality, allowing the application to speak the result of pneumonia detection.
In summary, this script combines PyQt5 for the GUI, TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning, and win32com for text-to-speech to create a desktop application for pneumonia detection in chest X-rays.
